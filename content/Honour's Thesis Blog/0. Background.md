I'm doing my honour's thesis! The topic here is about Just-in-Time query compilation in Relational Database engines. Step one here is to collect information about the current databases that do this, how they function and whether they're actually good. This page is a quick summary about the options around and how they work.


Most of the databases are from [dbdb io](https://dbdb.io/browse?query-compilation=jit-compilation)

# Open Source Databases
## Lingo Db
[Website](https://www.lingo-db.com/) | [Code](https://github.com/lingo-db/lingo-db) | Research papers [one](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol15/p2389-jungmair.pdf) [two](https://vldb.org/pvldb/vol14/p2483-bandle.pdf) | [Benchmarking Tools](https://github.com/lingo-db/lingo-db/tree/eee8c78847b2377ddc8b84974585182a7bb67700/resources/sql/tpch)


Their main ideas seem to be about making sub operators (scan, materialize, scatter, gather, map, fold, and loop) first-class entites and they use MLIR to support their compiler. The impressive thing is that it's very few lines of code - only about 2.5K - and they manage to get their query compiler quite reasonably fast. This means it's a good starting point for understanding the topic of my thesis, since it's mostly about the JIT compiler. It supports enough SQL operations to run TPC-H benchmarks

## Mutable
[Website](https://mutable.uni-saarland.de/) | [Code](https://github.com/mutable-org/mutable) | [Research paper](https://bigdata.uni-saarland.de/publications/Haffner,%20Dittrich%20-%20mutable:%20A%20Modern%20DBMS%20for%20Research%20and%20Fast%20Prototyping%20@CIDR2023.pdf)| [Benchmarking](https://github.com/mutable-org/mutable/blob/main/benchmark/README.md)

As they say, the main goal of this database is to produce prototypes very quickly for research ideas. They remedy this with metaprogramming and just in time compilation.
